# Rock Paper Scissors: Final Project Example
This is a reference implementation of level-appropriate Rock Paper Scissors.
This is a bare-bones, brute-force implementation using some method
abstraction, but there is no Java magic happening here.

What is happening is there is a looping interaction with the user that
is relatively fault tolerant and robust.

## Goal of the Final Project
Implement an interactive game of Rock paper Scissors with error handling and loops.

1) All input should be checked before using in other methods or code.
2) any malformed input should cause an exception, which will be handled by retrying the input action.
3) The game should offer a 'play again' option where the user can run through the game again without re-launching the project.
4) The Game should have win condtions and loss conditions for the User, as well as a Tie condition.
5) A message should be printed at the end of a game round telling the user who won, and what the choices were.
6) The program should run in a console in Netbeans with no arguments needed to play a game.

## Concepts Used in the Final Project
### Flow Control and Loops
This program will require the Students to create flow control constructs
 which will control the flow of data in and out in the program.
### Exception Handling
Students will need to handle any exceptions coming form malformed input.
### Conditional Logic
Conditional statements will need to be created and evaluated to create
the logical decision tree in the program
### Use of Methods
Some actions in the program can happen from different paths.
These actions should be in methods that can be called from the different conditional paths, instead of reapted code.
### Use of appropriate Data Types
Students will need to use the appropriate data type for each input and
output
