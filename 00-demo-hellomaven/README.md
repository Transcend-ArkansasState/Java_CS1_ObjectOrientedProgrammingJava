# Hello World Java Program with Maven

This is a Hello World Demonstration with Maven and JUnit tests.

Students would be expected to copy this code from an example (not copy/paste)
so they can test their Java environments. This will also give them a
working example project to base their future code projects on.

This project includes JUnit5 unit tests, so that any changes made to the code
or to the Java language in the future, this code can be quickly tested
by running the Maven commands and reading the test report.


Hello World code is found in /src/main/java/
JUnit test code is found in /src/test/java/

Maven build can be invoked with
```
mvn clean install
```

Tests will be run when this is built from the aggregating pom.xml, or if this project is built standalone.
