# Number Guessing Game 
This is an example implementation of the Student Assignment for Module 1

# Assignment Details:
Students will implement the following pseudo code:

1) Select a random whole number between 1 and 15 and save as a variable
2) Prompt the user for number input and save as a variable
3) If input is not a number, try again. If input is not a whole number, round down.
    Use java.util.Scanner and try{}catch{} keywords
4) Compare input to randomly selected number
5) Print "To high/Too Low Try again" or "You guessed right!" based on the comparison results [phrasing can be adjusted]
6) Repeat steps 2 through 4 until the user guesses correctly.
7) Print how many guesses it took the user to get the right one.

## Can be built with Maven like other projects.
Currently the Unit Tests are not complete. Just empty test classes. Will need to revisit this later.
